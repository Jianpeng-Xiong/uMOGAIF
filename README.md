Micro multi-objective genetic algorithm with information fitting strategy for low-power microprocessor
======
ü¶ãIntroduction
-------
Welcome to my GitHub homepage, where my papers and code are available. 
This is my project on micro multi-objective, which was accepted by ESWA in April 2025.
The work was mainly completed by my team member Fang. My work involves supervision, polishing, and guidance. The first author is my supervisor, Hu Peng, the second is Tian Fang, and I am the third author.
Fang is a hardworking girl whose research journey is exceptionally difficult, and her boring code and long rejection cycles have not defeated her.
Sharing and helping have also brought me tremendous progress.

ü¶•Environment
---
The operating environment is based on [Matlab2018b](https://www.mathworks.com/) at least. 
The platform we are using is [PlatEMO_v2.9](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). 
__You can directly use this to run the code.__ üòÉ
